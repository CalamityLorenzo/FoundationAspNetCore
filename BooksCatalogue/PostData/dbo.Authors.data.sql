His father, David Bernard Gaiman, worked in the same chain of stores;[12] his mother, Sheila Gaiman (née Goldman), was a pharmacist. He has two younger sisters, Claire and Lizzy.[13] After living for a period in the nearby town of Portchester, Hampshire, where Neil was born in 1960, the Gaimans moved in 1965 to the West Sussex town of East Grinstead where his parents studied Dianetics at the Scientology centre in the town; one of Gaiman''s sisters works for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. His other sister, Lizzy Calcioli, has said, "Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family. It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid. I’d say, ''I’m a Jewish Scientologist.''" Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist, and that like Judaism, Scientology is his family''s religion.[14] About his personal views, Gaiman has stated, "I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe. I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe. I don''t know, I think there''s probably a 50/50 chance. It doesn''t really matter to me."[15]ULL')
